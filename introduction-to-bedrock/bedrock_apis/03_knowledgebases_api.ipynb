    "<h2> Overview </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. It takes a use case of `chat with your document` capability, where you can securely ask questions on a single document, without the overhead of setting up a vector database or ingesting data, making it effortless for businesses to use their enterprise data. You only need to provide a relevant data file as input and choose your FM to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "For details around use cases and benefits, please refer to this [blogpost](#https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/knowledge-bases-in-amazon-bedrock-now-simplifies-asking-questions-on-a-single-document/).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2> Context </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html) allows you to integrate proprietary information into your generative-AI applications. Using the Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG) technique, a knowledge base searches your data to find the most useful information and then uses it to answer natural language questions. Once set up, you can take advantage of a knowledge base in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configure your RAG application to use the [RetrieveAndGenerate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_RetrieveAndGenerate.html\n",
    ") API to query your knowledge base and generate responses from the information it retrieves. You can also call the [Retrieve API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_Retrieve.html) to query your knowledge base with information retrieved directly from the knowledge base.\n",
    "- Associate your knowledge base with an agent (for more information, see [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html)) to add RAG capability to the agent by helping it reason through the steps it can take to help end users.\n",
    "- A knowledge base can be used not only to answer user queries, and analyze documents, but also to augment prompts provided to foundation models by providing context to the prompt. When answering user queries, the knowledge base retains conversation context. The knowledge base also grounds answers in citations so that users can find further information by looking up the exact text that a response is based on and also check that the response makes sense and is factually correct."

      "In the 25 years I’ve been at Amazon, there has been constant change, much of which we’ve initiated ourselves.\n",
      "When I joined Amazon in 1997, we had booked $15M in revenue in 1996, were a books-only retailer, did\n",

      "and retrieve all sorts of information.\n",

      "page_1\n",
      " Over the last several months,we took a deep look across the company, business by business, invention by\n",
      "invention, and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative’s long-term potential to drive\n",
      "enough revenue, operating income, free cash flow, and return on invested capital. In some cases, it led to us\n",
      "shuttering certain businesses. For instance, we stopped pursuing physical store concepts like our Bookstores\n",
      "and 4 Star stores, closed our Amazon Fabric and Amazon Care efforts, and moved on from some newer\n",
      "devices where we didn’t see a path to meaningful returns. In other cases, we looked at some programs that\n",
      "weren’t producing the returns we’d hoped (e.g. free shipping for all online grocery orders over $35) and\n",
      "amended them. We also reprioritized where to spend our resources, which ultimately led to the hard decision\n",

      "several months to streamline our overall costs, and like most leadership teams, we’ll continue to evaluate\n",
      "what we’re seeing in our business and proceed adaptively.\n",
      "We also looked hard athow we were working together as a team and asked our corporate employees to come\n",

      "get work done from home and did everything possible to keep up with the unexpected circumstances that\n",
      "presented themselves. It was impressive and I’m proud of the way our collective team came together to\n",
      "overcome unprecedented challenges for our customers, communities, and business. But, we don’t think it’s the\n",
      "best long-term approach. We’ve become convinced that collaborating and inventing is easier and more\n",

      "Serendipitous interactions help it, and there are more of those in-person than virtually. It’s also significantly\n",
      "easier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture when we’re in the office together most of the\n",
      "time and surrounded by our colleagues. Innovation and our unique culture have been incredibly important\n",
      "in our first 29 years as a company, and I expect it will be comparably so in the next 29.\n",
      "A critical challenge we’ve continued to tackle is the rising cost to serve in our Stores fulfillment network (i.e.\n",
      "the cost to get a product from Amazon to a customer)—andwe’ve made several changes that we believe will\n",
      "meaningfully improve our fulfillment costs and speed of delivery.\n",
      "During the early part of the pandemic, with many physical stores shut down, our consumer business grew\n",
      "at an extraordinary clip, with annual revenue increasing from $245B in 2019 to $434B in 2022. This meant that\n",
      "we had to double the fulfillment center footprint that we’d built over the prior 25 years and substantially\n",
      "accelerate building a last-mile transportation network that’s now the size of UPS (along with a new sortation\n",
      "center network to assist with efficiency and speed when items needed to traverse long distances)—all in the\n",
      "span of about two years. This was no easy feat, and hundreds of thousands of Amazonians worked very hard\n",
      "to make this happen. However, not surprisingly, with that rate and scale of change, there was a lot of\n",
      "optimization needed to yield the intended productivity. Over the last several months, we’ve scrutinized every\n",
      "process path in our fulfillment centers and transportation network and redesigned scores of processes and\n",
      "mechanisms, resulting in steady productivity gains and cost reductions over the last few quarters. There’s\n",
      "more work to do, but we’re pleased with our trajectory and the meaningful upside in front of us.\n",
      "We also took this occasion to make larger structural changes that set us up better to deliver lower costs and\n",
      "faster speed for many years to come. A good example was reevaluating how our US fulfillment network was\n",
      "organized. Until recently, Amazon operated one national US fulfillment network that distributed inventory\n",
      "from fulfillment centers spread across the entire country. If a local fulfillment center didn’t have the product a\n",
      "customer ordered, we’d end up shipping it from other parts of the country, costing us more and increasing\n",
      "delivery times. This challenge became more pronounced as our fulfillment network expanded to hundreds of\n",
      "additional nodes over the last few years, distributing inventory across more locations and increasing the\n",
      "complexity of connecting the fulfillment center and delivery station nodes efficiently. Last year, we started\n",
      "rearchitecting our inventory placement strategy and leveraging our larger fulfillment center footprint to move\n",
      "from a national fulfillment network to a regionalized network model. We made significant internal changes\n",
      "(e.g. placement and logistics software, processes, physical operations) to create eight interconnected regions in\n",
      "smaller geographic areas. Each of these regions has broad, relevant selection to operate in a largely self-\n",
      "sufficient way, while still being able to ship nationally when necessary. Some of the most meaningful and hard\n",
      "page_1\n",
      " work came from optimizing the connections between this large amount of infrastructure. We also continue\n",
      "to improve our advanced machine learning algorithms to better predict what customers in various parts of the\n",
      "country will need so that we have the right inventory in the right regions at the right time. We’ve recently\n",
      "completed this regional roll out and like the early results. Shorter travel distances mean lower cost to serve,\n",
      "less impact on the environment, and customers getting their orders faster. On the latter, we’re excited about\n",
      "seeing more next day and same-day deliveries, and we’re on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds\n",
      "ever in 2023. Overall, we remain confident about our plans to lower costs, reduce delivery times, and build a\n",
      "meaningfully larger retail business with healthy operating margins.\n",
      "AWS has an $85B annualized revenue run rate, is still early in its adoption curve, but at a juncture where it’s\n",
      "critical to stay focused on what matters most to customers over the long-haul. Despite growing 29% year-over-\n",
      "year (“Y oY”) in 2022 on a $62B revenue base, AWS faces short-term headwinds right now as companies\n",
      "are being more cautious in spending given the challenging, current macroeconomic conditions. While some\n",
      "companies might obsess over how they could extract as much money from customers as possible in these tight\n",
      "times, it’s neither what customers want nor best for customers in the long term, so we’re taking a different\n",
      "tack. One of the many advantages of AWS and cloud computing is that when your business grows, you can\n",
      "seamlessly scale up; and conversely, if your business contracts, you can choose to give us back that capacity\n",
      "and cease paying for it. This elasticity is unique to the cloud, and doesn’t exist when you’ve already made\n",
      "expensive capital investments in your own on-premises datacenters, servers, and networking gear. In AWS,\n",
      "like all our businesses, we’re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We’re trying to build customer\n",
